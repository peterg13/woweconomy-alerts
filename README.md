# woweconomy-alerts
Sends out an alert when there is potential money to be made on the auction house

Goals:
1. Using online resources, gather price of "laestrite ore" and send out a notification when its price is below a threshold.
2. Gather prices of all the prospecting materials from the ore and determine potential gain/loss of current price.  If money can be made send out a notification.
3. Expand.
